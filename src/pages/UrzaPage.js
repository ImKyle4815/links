                <h2>What's Ask Urza 2.0?</h2>
                <p>Ask Urza 2.0 is a fan-made, reimagined version of the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/unresources#funhouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">"Ask Urza" webpage</a> made by Wizards of the Coast for a card named Urza, Academy Headmaster. Ask Urza traditionally has 20 randomized effects for each of its three loyalty abilities, but Ask Urza 2.0 takes things a step further. Here, you're randomly drawing from every planeswalker abilities that has ever been printed on a Magic card.</p>
                <p>We periodically compile a list of every planeswalker ability and sort them into the three categories. Currently, the thresholds are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>+1: any ability costing +1 or more</li>
                    <li>-1: any ability costing between -3 and 0</li>
                    <li>-6: any ability costing -4 or less</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The list of planeswalker abilities was last compiled on February 24th, 2023.</p>
